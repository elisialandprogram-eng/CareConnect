I need to enhance the provider profile and booking system.

Requirement:
- A provider can offer **multiple services**
- Each service can have **multiple practitioners** (doctors/nurses/therapists etc.)
- Each practitioner can have **different fees**
- During booking, the patient must be able to:
  1. Select a **service**
  2. Select a **practitioner** assigned to that service
  3. See the **fee for that practitioner**
  4. Book appointment with selected practitioner

Please implement the following changes:

1. Database Schema:
   - Create new tables:

     a) services
        - id (uuid)
        - provider_id (foreign key)
        - name
        - description
        - duration_minutes
        - created_at
        - updated_at

     b) practitioners
        - id (uuid)
        - provider_id (foreign key)
        - name
        - title
        - specialization
        - bio
        - languages (array)
        - created_at
        - updated_at

     c) service_practitioners (junction table)
        - id (uuid)
        - service_id (foreign key)
        - practitioner_id (foreign key)
        - fee (numeric)
        - is_active (boolean)
        - created_at
        - updated_at

2. Backend API:
   - Add endpoints:
     - GET /api/providers/:providerId/services
     - GET /api/providers/:providerId/services/:serviceId/practitioners
     - POST /api/booking (include serviceId + practitionerId + fee)

   - Update booking logic:
     - Validate that practitioner belongs to the selected service
     - Validate fee matches the service_practitioners table
     - Save booking with service_id and practitioner_id

3. Frontend UI:
   - Provider Profile:
     - Add a section “Services & Practitioners”
     - Provider can add/edit:
       - Services
       - Practitioners
       - Assign practitioners to services
       - Set fees per practitioner per service

   - Booking Page:
     - Step 1: Choose Service
     - Step 2: Choose Practitioner (only practitioners assigned to that service)
     - Step 3: Confirm Fee and Book

4. Data Migration:
   - Ensure existing provider profile remains intact
   - Add sample seed data for testing

5. Deployment:
   - Apply migrations to Supabase
   - Ensure backend and frontend builds successfully

Please implement this feature fully and provide confirmation once done.
